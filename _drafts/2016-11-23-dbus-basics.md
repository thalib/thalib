D-BUS is an IPC (inter-process communication) mechanism that helps applications communicate with each other. D-Bus  (Desktop  Bus)  is  a  simple  IPC,  developed  as  part  of  [freedesktop  projects](https://dbus.freedesktop.org).

D-Bus  bindings  are  available  for  C/C++,  Glib,  Java,  Python,  Perl,  Ruby,  etc.

### D-Bus basics

> D-Bus is a message bus system, a simple way for applications to talk to one another

D-Bus  is  a  service  daemon  that  runs  in  the  background.  We  use  bus  daemons  to  interact  with  applications  and  their  functionalities.  The  bus  daemon forwards  and  receives  messages  to  and  from  applications.  There  are  two  types  of  bus  daemons:  SessionBus  and  SystemBus.

* System daemon is launched at the system startup level and used mainly for hardware events
* Session daemon is launched when the user login to a desktop environment and it is for use for desktop applications to connect to each other

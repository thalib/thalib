excerpt: Prisoners vs Free in Workplace
---

I came across a interesting article [Prisoners & Free Agents](https://nirmalyakumar.com/2016/11/19/prisoners-and-free-agents/) by Nirmalya Kumar

According to Nirmalya Kumar, Employees can be classed as **free agents** versus **prisoners**. An employee’s availability of alternatives to the present employer can be conceptualized as how long it would take to find another acceptable job and how much it would pay relative to the current compensation. Clearly, the faster one can find another job at a salary higher or similar, the less dependent one is on the current employer. This led him to place all employees in two buckets those with high availability of alternatives whom I dubbed as **free agents** versus those with low availability of alternatives or **prisoners** in his terminology.

In simple words **Prisoners** are those who had negotiated too high a compensation have little choice but to make public displays of loyalty to the organizational leader.

Here are my take away from that article

* NEVER negotiate too much on compensation, too attractive a compensation package would turn you into a prisoner.

* One should have the feeling that **I could walk out any day if I didn't like my employment**. This will make you *feel who you are and fearlessly share what is on my mind*
* Often Organizations are populated by prisoners who believe they are free agents because it is hard to pinpoint.

From a management perspective, managing free agents requires a different approach than managing prisoners

* Prisoners can be managed with **carrot and stick** approach
* **Carrots** are rewards, **Sticks** are threats or punishment
* Sticks are extremely effective against prisoners, at least in the short run
* Carrots may be used to motivate free agents may work, but these methods will not be as effective as they are for prisoners.
* Sticks are **USELESS** when deployed against free agents. Free agents will **simply leave the organization** if their managers ask them to obey under the threat of punishment.

* If the employee complies, there is a cost to the organization that is Carrot (price of fulfilling the promise and giving the reward)
* Threats and punishments have no such explicit costs associated. If people comply, there is no need to levy the punishment, so it seems free.
* Sticks have negative side effect on organization on long run, it costs in terms of **DECLINING MORALE AND FOSTERING A CORROSIVE CULTURE**.

Rather than rewards and punishments, influencing free agents requires more elaborate strategies. For free agents to comply with instructions from superiors, it requires providing information and arguments in support of such requests. Free agents will query why should they do what they are being asked to. Beyond using expertise and information, referent power is also effective on free agents. Referent power exists when free agents view the person who is trying to influence them as inspirational. For referent power to operate, the free agent must look up to the executive seeking to gain compliance from them as this reduces counter arguments on the part of the free agent. The difficulty with expertise and referent power in organizational settings is that it does not always flow with hierarchical positions.

Over my career, I have observed that most managers prefer to be prison wardens rather than viewing themselves as coaches of star teams. You may have noticed that when sports teams do not perform, it is the coach who gets fired rather than the players. Coaches are easier to find than talent on the field. Brilliant coaches deploy expertise and referent power to influence their players instead of rewards and punishments. As they are bound by contracts and hard to replace, it is not easy to let players go. Furthermore, successful athletes are too rich at a young age, limiting the value of monetary incentives.
The academic environment has dynamics comparable to sports teams. Faculty, especially the stars, have tenure (lifetime employment) and annual raises tend to be relatively small compared to what one can earn via consulting assignments. Thus, deans have limited reward and punishment powers. I once recall telling a dean that I do not respond to incentives because that is how you control rats in a cage.
Organization’s contend talent is critical to their success. But the relative proportion of free agents to prisoners necessary for success differs dramatically across organizations. One needs to reflect deeply on the business model and core competences to assess this.
Finally, I hope we reflect on our own managerial style. If you have only managed prisoners, then have you really managed anyone? Once you remove the ability to reward and punish, I find that most managers become naked.

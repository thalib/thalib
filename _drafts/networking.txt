Ingnore / Block Ping request(ICMP)
=====================================
Generally you can use iptables to block or allow ping requests.

You can setup kernel variable to drop all ping packets. Type the following command at shell prompt:
# echo "1" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

This instructs the kernel to simply ignore all ping requests (ICMP type 0 messages). To enable ping request type the command:
echo "0" > /proc/sys/net/ipv4/icmp_echo_ignore_all

Throughput - Explaination
==========================

As per RFC1242 and RFC2544 both definitions are correct as below

[RFC1242] Definition: The maximum rate at which none of the offered frames are dropped by the device
[RFC2544] Test method : The throughput is the fastest rate at which the count of test frames transmitted by the DUT is equal to the number of test frames sent to it by the test equipment

In simple formula

Throughput = speed at [no.of transmitted frames == no.of received frames]

Acceptance loss:

From the above definition of throughput we can say that no.of frames received should be equal to no.of frames transmitted.

still for some scenario we can relax the rules in throughput testing this is done through adjusting acceptance loss in %

Example

Here we will consider 100 packets to explain

Case 1:

If we set the acceptance loss as 0% then the test smartbit will generate 100 and expect to receive 100 frames if doesn't receive 100 frame at that bandwidth (speed) then it will reduce the speed the bandwidth and do the test again until it receives what it sent

in this case the pass is considered to 100% and loss should be not above 0% ( that means no drop in frames)

Case 2:

For some scenario if we set the acceptance loss as 60% then the test smartbit will generate 100 and expect to receive 40 frames if doesn't receive 40 frame at that bandwidth (speed) then it will reduce the speed the bandwidth and do the test again until it receives 40% of what it sent

in this case the pass is considered to be 40% and loss should be not above 60%


Types of throughput testing

ZLT (Zero Loss Throughput)

the acceptance loss should be 0% that means no drop in frames

Flooding Throughput

the acceptance loss should be 100% , it doesn't bother about the frame drops just pump the packed at max bandwidth, this is useful to test the stability of DUT

Adjusting Acceptance loss:

(same as explained above copy pasted below)

for some scenario if we set the acceptance loss as 60% then the test smartbit will generate 100 and expect to receive 40 frames if doesn't receive 40 frame at that bandwidth (speed) then it will reduce the speed the bandwidth and do the test again until it receives 40% of what it sent

in this case the pass is considered to be 40% and loss should be not above 60%


Note: As per industry standard and defined in RFC standards the ZLT is the throughput of any device so the acceptance loss should be set to 0% in smartbits application

Summary: In this guide we will try to capture the brief history of Panchagavya an organic fertilizer, formulation.

Panchagavya is a organic fertilizer that enhanced the biological efficiency of crop plants and the quality of fruits and vegetables. Panchagavya's origin is from Indian subcontinent. 

In Sanskrit, Panchagavya means the blend of five products obtained from cow (ghee, milk, curd, cow dung and cow's urine). (Pancha means five, All these five products are individually called 'Gavya' and collectively termed as 'Panchagavya'). 

Panchagavya (பஞ்ச காவ்யா) is prepared and used as Indian medicine for more than 2000 years, but using it in agriculture is first pioneered by Kodumudi Dr. Natrajan (கொடுமுடி டாக்டர் நடராஜன் ) .  Dr. Natrajan from Kodumudi is a MBBS doctor by profession. (*Reference Pasumai Vikatan Magazine*)

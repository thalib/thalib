Proximity Sensors

Capacitive Proximity Sensors - Capacitive proximity sensors detect the presence or proximity of a target using capacitive technology.

Eddy Current Proximity Sensors - Eddy current proximity sensors and switches detect the proximity or presence of a target by sensing the magnetic fields generated by a reference coil.

Hall Effect Proximity Sensors - Hall effect proximity sensors are used to detect the proximity, presence or absence of a magnetic object using a critical distance.

Inductive Proximity Sensors - Inductive proximity sensors detect the presence or absence of an object using a critical distance.


Photoelectric Sensors - Photoelectric sensors use emitters and receivers to detect the presence, absence, or distance of target objects.

Ultrasonic sensors - Ultrasonic sensors can measure distance without contact.

### CASE 1: ISRO spy case [1994]

> On 15th Feb, 2017 India created a world record by successfully putting into orbit 104 satellites in a single mission.

Former ISRO scientist **S Nambi Narayanan** was instrumental in designing the system used in Chandrayaan, Mangalyaan and PSLV that launched 104 satellites in one go.

> "There, they are using the same system that I worked upon and developed. But here, I am still fighting to get justice. I have wasted my 25 years,"
> - Nambi Narayanan

Narayanan's career was ruined after the 1994 ISRO spying scandal made headlines.

**[WHAT HAPPENED] :** On **October 20, 1994** Kerala police arrested Mariam Rasheeda — a Maldivian woman for overstaying in India, police later accused her of being involved in a sex-spy scandal.

Following this events Kerala police arrested ISRO Scientist S Nambi Narayanan. It was alleged that Rasheeda was the intermediary between the organisation and two more women. She was accused of passing on ISRO’S cryogenic programme secrets to the women, who in turn supplied the same to Russia and Pakistan’s ISI.

Two years later, the **CBI cleared all the accused**, who were discharged in **May 1996**. CBI also filed a closure report before the court.

But the culprits from police department with the help of kerala govt dismised the CBI investigation report and Kerala police was asked to hold a fresh inquiry.

**In 1998**, the Supreme Court quashed the state government’s decision. The apex court had in 1998 granted compensation of **Rs 1 lakh** to Narayanan and others who were discharged in the case and directed the state government to pay the amount.

Later, Narayanan had approached NHRC claiming compensation against the state government for **mental agony and torture suffered by him**. The NHRC, after hearing both sides and taking into account the apex court judgment of April 29, 1998 awarded an interim compensation of **Rs 10 lakh** on **March 14, 2001**.

However, a division bench reversed the order in March 2015, which Narayanan has challenged before the Supreme Court. His grievance is that despite the CBI probe indicting the police officers, **the state has not taken any action against the errant police officials**.

Today all the officers of Kerala police former **DGP Siby Mathews** and two retired Superintendents of Police, **K.K. Joshua and S. Vijayan** who illegaly setup the case are now retired and free, soon they we will be dead.

But the 75-year-old Former ISRO scientist S Nambi Narayanan, is fighting a case  to get justice for fabricated spying case setup against him.

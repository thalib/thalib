## October 2016

### Yet another FAKE encounter and prision break drama

In the history this incident will be know as #BhopalEncounter or #SIMIEncounter, the police version is that eight SIMI members booked in different case locked in Bhopal prison, killed a guard and escaped from prison. Later all were gunned down by MP Police's anti-terror unit.

Jail officials claim

* **bedsheets** were used to scaled a wall nearly **30-feet** high
* Opened the locks by using **toothbrushes** as **keys**.
* Security cameras were **NOT** working (in high-security prison where SIMI prisoners locked up)

The **IMPORTANT** point is that
* all eight members of SIMI were under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**.
* NEWS,  MEDIA and POLITICIAN were ready to pass judgment as these peoples are TERRORIST, because they are **Muslims**

**Here is why fake encounter is for?**

* BJP Rules Madhya Pradesh
* CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is fed up with feeding CHICKEN BIRYANI in jail
* Some thing fishy, because jawan was kill in [Thirudan Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirudan_Police) movie style.
* The case against 8 peoples don't have evidence(FAKE), So the case may be dismissed by the court.
* The MP Police to hide their fault has to kill them.
* The youths were **Muslims**

The sad thing is one jawan and eighth innocent youth were killed (they under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**), the case will be now easily closed.

## November 2016

### Tamil Nadu state enters 60th Year (Diamond jubilee)

On November 1st, 2016 is 60th Year (Diamond jubilee) of Tamil Nadu State formation.

The Tamils did'nt in the mood to celebrate it, because most don't know the history about it. At a time when neighboring Kerala and Karnataka are celebrating the day.

The government should honor those people who have made sacrifices during the *frontier struggles* just like honoring those engaged in Independence struggle.

### Ex-Serviceman Committed Suicide over Pension

The 70-year-old ex-serviceman Ram Kishan Grewal from Haryana's Bhiwani district who served in the Army and the Defense Security Corps for 30 years, committed suicide by consuming poison over the issue of One Rank One Pension scheme (OROP).

Shame on the Govt, and their dirty politics. This is how we honor the hero's who sacrificed their time and life for the country. As usual the blame game started between politicians.

### PM Tours Calender

* November 2016 - Japan

## October 2016

### Yet another FAKE encounter and prision break drama

In the history this incident will be know as #BhopalEncounter or #SIMIEncounter, the police version is that eight SIMI members booked in diffrent case locked in Bhopal persion, killed a guard and escaped from prision. Later all were gunned down by MP Police's anti-terror unit.

The **IMPORTANT** point is that all eight members of SIMI were under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**. But news media and polictician were ready to give judgment, and claimed them to be TERRORIST, because they are Muslims. The case case against 8 peoples were not strong, so they could be release by the court. The MP Police to hide their fault has to kill them.

The sad thing is one jawans and eith innocent youth were killed (they under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**).

I think there is some thing fishy, because jawan was kill in [Thirudan Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirudan_Police) movie style.

### Tamil Nadu state enters 60th Year (Diamond jubilee)

On November 1st, 2016 is 60th Year (Diamond jubilee) of Tamil Nadu State formation.

The Tamils did'nt in the mood to celebrate it, because most don't know the history about it. At a time when neighbouring Kerala and Karnataka are celebrating the day.

The government should honour those people who have made sacrifices during the *frontier struggles* just like honouring those engaged in Independence struggle.

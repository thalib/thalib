China is seeing slowdown in the economy, during this time many nations try to mimic the China model and replicates its growth success.

Everyone only think about the cheap labor which made the China growth possible.

But the reality for success is

- cheap labor (Modi is trying to mimic this with MAKE IN INDIA)
- one nation, one people
- infrastructure
- its resources (China supplies more than 50% of worlds raw material demand)
- Price vs Quality (What you get is what you pay for)

The slow down of china is not just one countries slowdown, its a slowdown of worlds production hub slowdown. The world will see the price rise in every product.

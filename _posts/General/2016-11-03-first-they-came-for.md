---


Here is the indian version of the famous poet, [First they came for](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_they_came_...) by Rev. Martin Niemöller's


> First they came for the Muslims, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Muslims.
>
> Then they came for the Cristians, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Cristians.
>
> Then they came for the Dalit, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Dalit.
>
> Then they came for the Dalit, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Dalit.
>
> Then they came for the Communist, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Communist.
>
> Then they came for the Socialist, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Socialist.
>
> Then they came for the Secularist, and I did not speak out—
> Because I was not a Secularist.

Then they came for me—and there was no one left to speak for me.

Once the Bluetooth controllers are registered with the kernel, the bluetooth interface can be listed from sys entry

```
# ls /sys/class/bluetooth
hci0
```

### rfkill

Lets make sure the bluetooth device is turned on and not blocked using rfkill command.

```
sudo rfkill list
[sudo] password for mohamed:
2: hci0: Bluetooth
	Soft blocked: no
	Hard blocked: no
```

If bluetooth device is blocked it can be unblocked

```
sudo rfkill unblock bluetooth
```

### hciconfig

hciconfig is similar to ifconfig command, which is used to list the local bluetooth interfaces information, turn up/down are more. Refer help for more commands/options.

Now, lets bring up the bluetooth device with hciconfig command.

```
sudo hciconfig hci0 up
```

```

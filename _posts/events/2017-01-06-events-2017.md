### Bengaluru molestation on the New Year Eve Celebration

> In midnight, men in the crowd (~ one lakh+) simply went nuts. Bengaluru’s depraved men started pawing and groping at any girl they could get their hands on. Women ran for their lives.

Since 90s every year incidents of girls being molested have occurred almost every year with unfailing regularity the perpetrators have never been caught. This time in 2017 its a **MASS MOLESTATION**, there is every indication that the perverts will get away with it.

Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh, posted in 42 Infantry Brigade in Dehradun, said that after he wrote to the prime minister, the defence minister, the president and the Supreme Court in June last year, his brigade received a communication from PMO asking for a probe into his grievances.

He said when the Prime Minister’s Office wrote back to the Brigade asking it to investigate the matter, “the Brigadier put pressure on me and tortured me to such a level that I could have taken an extreme step. But I will not commit suicide or act in any way or against anyone that will tarnish the name of my service,” he said.

The video has come to light as two similar clips have been trending on social media.

* In one of the videos, a CRPF constable demanded parity in pay and other benefits between the army and the paramilitary forces, citing the difficult assignments they had to undertake.
* In the other video, a BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav has complained about [poor quality food served](http://www.firstpost.com/india/bsf-jawan-tej-bahadur-yadavs-video-is-not-about-a-diet-problem-it-reflects-a-deeper-malaise-3201720.html) to them in icy weather condition on the border in Jammu and Kashmir.

> No amount of lipstick can make pig look better.
> No amount of fake patriotism can hide the fact that our armed forces, BSF and CRPF are as rotten as the rest of the society!

### PM Modi Replaces Mahatma Gandhi On Khadi Calendar

PM Modi triggered a flurry of reactions after reports emerged that his photograph had replaced an iconic shot of Mahatma Gandhi with his spinning wheel, on the new Khadi Udyog merchandise.

The PM’s photograph -- which was published on the cover pages of the Khadi Village Industries Commission’s (KVIC) 2017 calendar and diary -- shows Modi weaving khadi on a large ‘charkha’, in the same classic pose as Gandhi.

The decision, however, did not sit well with everyone.

Mohsin was brutally beaten and was left bleeding and unconscious on the road; his friend escaped.

Three of the 21 arrested (Vijay Rajendra Gambhire, Ranjeet Shankar Yadav and Ajay Dilip Lalge) - were granted bail on 12-Jan-2016 by the Bombay High Court, which says they were "PROVOKED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION AND THEY COMMITTED MURDER."

HC judge **Mridula Bhatkar** [said in her order](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/provoked-over-religion-says-judge-giving-bail-to-muslim-mans-killers-1649602)

> "The fault of the deceased was only that he belonged to another religion. I consider this factor in favour of the accused. Moreover, the accused do not have any criminal record and it appears that in the name of the religion, they were provoked and have committed the murder".

**Lesson learnt**

The protesters demanded is one

> that the chief minister issue a statement to clarify the state's position on the Jallikattu issue and added that the protest will not cease until such a time.

It looks like [Tamil Nadu version of the Arab Spring](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-witnessing-mass-students-uprising-for-jallikattu/articleshow/56641218.cms), or it may even remind you of the anti-Hindi agitation in the state in the 1960s. It is happening students and youngsters are on the roads and public places demanding the conduct of jallikattu, the traditional bull-taming sport in the state.

> Nothing will happen to the accused, as Corrupt Police and Money licking Judiciary will support him.

### Colonel Nizamuddin, Netaji's trusted friend, dies at 117

Not many have heard about Colonel Nizamuddin, one of the many foot-soldiers from Indian freedom struggle, who died as an unsung hero on Monday morning. On Tuesday, media reports say Nizamuddin died at the age of 117 in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh.

Born in 1901, Nizamuddin is survived by his wife Ajbul Nisha, three sons and two daughters. His youngest son Sheikh Akram was by his side when the end came in the early hours today. Nizamuddin, who had served in the Indian National Army from 1943-45. Nizamuddin fought for the country's freedom in Singapore and Burma (now Myanmar) as a soldier in Netaji's Indian National Army (INA).

He was the trusted driver and bodyguard of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Nizamuddin was the same man who took three bullets to save Netaji in the forests of Burma, according to a report published by The Telegraph.

He accompanied Bose during his meeting with Hitler to seek help to secure freedom for India. He also accompanied Bose during his trips to Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

He insisted he was Jayalalithaa's choice for the chief ministerial position and that Sasikala and her supporters threatened and forced him to resign from the CM post.

> "I will withdraw my resignation, if people wish... I would fight to save the party and the goodwill of Jayalalithaa's legacy," he said.

The scenario is very similar to the winter of 1987-88 following the death of MGR, similar war errupted between Janaki Ramachandran, widow of the late MGR, and Jayalalithaa. We have to wait and watch.

> We, the faculty members of the English Department, Lady Shri Ram College unequivocally and strongly support our student Gurmehar Kaur and her right to express her opinion on issues that embroil our university. It is immensely gratifying to us as her teachers that she has responded sensitively, creatively and bravely to events in her immediate context rather than seek the safe refuge of silence.
> We feel that it is the bounden duty of educational institutions to nurture sensitive, responsive and critical thinking students without the fear of violent retaliation.

### Tamil Nadu trade bodies to bycott Pepsi, Coca-Cola

Tamil Nadu Traders Federation (TNTF) and Consortium of Tamil Nadu Traders Association (CTNTA) have urged the traders in the state to shun Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and promote regional brands, Kali Mark, Bovonto and Torino, from **1 March**. This move is partly inspired by the jallikkattu protests, which have also been viewed as assertion of the state's cultural freedom.

Good Job! but on 2nd March The Madras High Court lifted a ban on Coca Cola and Pepsi from using River Tamirparani's water in Tamil Nadu. The cola giants were stopped from using the river water after protests, four months ago.
The argument against the companies were that thousands of farmers are suffering because the river water is being used for commercial gain. The companies, however, said that the water used in manufacturing cola was the surplus.

### Hard work is more powerful than Harvard - says Prime Minister Narendra Modi

At an election rally in Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday, in an apparent dig at economists who have criticised the government’s demonetisation move.

> On the one hand are those (critics of note ban) who talk of what people at Harvard say and on the other hand is a poor man’s son who through his hard work is trying to improve the economy - [Prime Minister Narendra Modi](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7Hxx3U5JmdXn0txK0pZu8L/Hard-work-more-powerful-than-Harvard-says-Narendra-Modi.html)

Modi's brings recent GDP figures released by the Central Statistics Office as a proof. Indian economy grew by 7.0% in the December quarter, indicating that the impact of demonetisation was negligible on economic growth.

This clearly shows PM does not know what is GDP, some one needs to explain him what is GDP.

But Pronab Sen, the former Secretary of the Statistics Ministry, points out,

> the GDP data is collected at the factory level but did not capture the inventories lying idle at automobile showrooms, departmental stores and other retail outlets.
> the GDP figures for the January-March quarter will probably reflect the disruption caused by demonetisation more accurately
> you can only push out so much inventory but if it is piling up in retail stores and not being sold, the factories won’t be able to send out manufactured products. - Pronab Sen told News18,

the real output will come in the up comming quarters

### Dhoni Aadhar details on social media.

Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s [Aadhaar details were made public by a Twitter handle](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/ms-dhonis-aadhaar-leak-raises-questions-on-data-safety-and-privacy-4590997/) of the Central Services Centre. The leak has raised the issue of privacy of individuals and security of data collected by the government for Aadhaar. The government has been on an overdrive to implement Aadhaar and link it to both welfare and non-welfare schemes in the country. But, it is a serious concern when personal information of an individual is not kept secure and leaked out in the public domain. Despite implementing advanced technological safeguards, a thing as simple as human error breached the security of Aadhaar. Perhaps the focus should be on ensuring complete safety to Aadhaar data, at the collection points as well as storage repositories, instead of showing urgency to impose it on citizens.

Furthermore, there are security loopholes which are continuously being flagged but instead of paying heed to them and resolving the issues, the government seems to be in denial. In recent reports, it was seen how people were able to gain more than one Aadhaar enrollment IDs. Social media is littered with posts, some claiming to be evidence, of more extensive security vulnerabilities or compromise of Aadhaar.

### EVM votes only for one party

An Electronic Voting Machine that was reported to have voted for a particular party during a demonstration in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday reignited the opposition charge that [tampered EVMs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/evm-in-madhya-pradesh-votes-just-for-bjp-says-opposition-seeking-probe-1676116) had helped the BJP in the last round of assembly elections.

### Begging is a crime in 20 Indian states and 2 union territories.

You're under arrest for 'looking poor': Indians in 20 states, 2 union territories can be arrested for begging

I didn't know that, Many state laws treat begging within the jurisdiction of court and as a non-bailable offense. Most state laws allow the police to arrest anyone they think is a beggar without a warrant, [Hindustan Times](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-can-be-arrested-for-looking-poor-in-most-indian-states-and-union-territories/story-Tvssf0mLY7NnVFvApYy5XO.html) reported.

Except in the state of Tamil Nadu and Assam, most of the state laws take into account the fact that not having means to sustain a livelihood or if the person is wandering, he's a beggar.

Laws in India legitimately grant the police the [authority to arrest beggars](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/looking-poor-people-20-states-2-union-territories-arrested-begging/1/918198.html), that too without a warrant.

### Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Press Conference Highlights

Here are the live updates of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's press conference:
* The law says you can't move the EVMs 45 days after polls.
* What was the compulsion of the EC to blatantly break the law and move the Kanpur machine to Bhind?
* That means there can be other machines that also took votes just for the BJP.
* Earlier when EVMs were tampered, you could see if your vote went to other party, thanks to the light.
* Now they have tweaked the software so much that the light is correct but the vote goes to the wrong party.
* It also appears that not all machines but some machines were tampered and they were placed critically.
* The EC says the software of EMVs are not over-writable. We want these machines handed to us and we will get it tested by our own experts.
* This is a matter of the entire country's faith. It raises serious questions on the EC's integrity.
* All elections are under threat. People will lose their faith in the voting system.
* Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia: The EC needs to investigate why the machine that came from UP, voted for BJP no matter which button you pressed. Questions have been raised on the EC's intent. Look at how that officer bullied reporters, threatening them with locking them up in the jail. Advanced countries all over the world have rejected EVMs. Why? This is not a malfunction. This is an intentional bug that has been added to the machine.
* Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal: We are challenging the EC. EC says software cannot be overwritten. We challenge them: Under camera, in presence of your officers, give us the machines for 72 hours - we will show you how the software can be overwritten.
* Its not about our josh. It is about the faith of the people. People are asking me why should we vote if our votes aren't counted. There is no other way than going back to paper ballots. Democracy is under threat.

### Man Killed By Alleged Cow Vigilantes

Beef Politics Returns: In a video that is being widely circulated, a mob of self-styled cow vigilantes assaults five men who were transporting cows in **Rajasthan's Alwar**. One man is seen slumped on the road, unconscious. Pehlu Khan(55), [died in hospital](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/man-killed-by-alleged-cow-vigilantes-in-rajasthan-attack-caught-on-camera-1677453) yesterday, two days after the brutal beating, and his four companions are in hospital.

They were dragged out of their pick-up truck on the highway, [chased and thrashed](http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-alleged-cow-vigilantes-caught-on-camera-beating-man-to-death-in-alwar-375636), shows the video apparently filmed by locals.

**Update:** The reality is that according to a report in the [Indian Express](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/alwar-gau-rakshaks-killed-a-dairy-farmer-not-cattle-smuggler-4601434/), Pehlu Khan owned a dairy farm in **Haryana's Mewat**. Khan was planning to buy a milch buffalo when he set out from Mewat to Jaipur last Friday. As a dairy farmer, he wanted to increase the production of milk during Ramadan. But on Saturday, Khan bought a milch cow instead, as the seller extracted **12 litres of mil**k in front of him, and offered to sell the cow for a reasonable price.

A Documents accessed by [India Today](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/alwar-gau-rakshak-attack-murder-cattle-farm-owner-pehlu-khan/1/921761.html) had earlier showed that Khan had **valid Jaipur Municipal Corporation receipts** to transport cattle and that he was not in fact smuggling cows.

The five men were also **robbed of their wallets and cellphones**. Irshad reportedly had about Rs 75,000 while another person lost about Rs 35,000.

Are they not terrorits, but they are called Cow Protectors/Gau rakshaks ?

This led to a scuffle between the two groups and the youths allegedly thrashed the groom and other members of the marriage party.The attackers not only thrashed the groom but even took away the mare.

American warships in the region launched 59 Tomahawk cruise missiles at an airfield controlled by President Bashar al-Assad in the war-torn country. The U.S action is in response to a chemical attack that killed at least 80 people including children earlier this week in a rebel controlled area.

### Farmers from Tamil Nadu calling off their protest at Jantar Mantar

> Gandhigiri doesn't work in India anymore.

For 41 days, TN farmers tried all ways of peacefully protest like drink their own urine, ran naked in front of the prime minister's residence, carried the skulls of their loved ones who had died or committed suicide since October last year, ate food served on the road, clutched live rats and dead snakes in their mouth. But except attracting media attention, and even that was more because of the macabre optics of their protest, [their non-violent approach did not achieve anything](http://www.firstpost.com/india/tamil-nadu-farmers-call-off-protest-stirring-a-grim-reminder-of-how-far-removed-state-has-become-from-india-3400686.html).

It may sound an extreme reaction to those living north of the Vindhyas, but New Delhi has pushed Tamil Nadu, and to an extent south India, a bit further away with the

Farmers wanted to feel the "mann", but they returned to Chennai heartbroken that they did not get to hear any "mann ki baat".


**Why were the farmers agitating in Delhi and not in Chennai?**

Simply because their protests in different districts of Tamil Nadu over the past many months had yielded zilch. Did anyone outside Tamil Nadu even know about them clutching live rats? They wanted a loan waiver from nationalised banks, wanted the Centre to give a significant drought relief package to Tamil Nadu and a Cauvery Management Board that would give them a decent share of the river water even in a bad year.

All the most importat is, in TN state we don't know who is CM, there is lockdown with the ruling AIADMK party engaged in political firefighting.

> This sends a clear message to anyone wants to protest that Gandhigiri ways do not work. Copy the Jat agitation of 2016 when rail tracks were uprooted causing Rs 100 crore loss to the Railway?

Extending solidarity to the cause of the farmer that the group called life giver, a number of suggestions poured in on the way forward. The group now plans to take up the farmer's fight together, organise confidence building amongst them, involve schools in the process and create a mass movement for the cause.

> "It is deplorable that farmers in the past few weeks have had to use such ways of peaceful protest where they have put rats in their mouth, eaten grass, protested with skulls. They have now had to drink their urine and not even one representative of the government has met with them,"
> "This is not less than a death of democracy. What more should the farmer do to get the government;s attention?" - said Deepak Kabir.

the attendees condemned accusations by some of the farmer protests being 'sponsored'.

> "I will give my entire month's' salary to the person who can undertake all the protest ways that have been used by the farmers at Jantar Mantar. Who can do such things to oneself even if being sponsored?" - Awadesh, a teacher by profession.

Thanks the kind hearts for the support.

### 300 Maoist guerillas attacked 99-member CRPF troop

hundreds of Maoists on Monday ambushed and massacred at least 25 CRPF personnel in Chhattisgarh's Sukma district and escaped with their AK-47 assault rifles. The "strong" 99-member CRPF battalion was on foot patrolling the interior road — the team was entrusted with the task of providing security to a road construction project  — when it came under sudden attack.

Many families lost thier love one.

**Update: Why was the troops killed?**

The Dand Karanya Special Zonal Committee (DKSZC) of the banned Communist Party of India (Maoist) [claimed in an audio clip](http://www.deccanchronicle.com/nation/current-affairs/280417/sukma-attack-response-to-sexual-violence-murder-of-villagers-maoists.html) on Thursday that the massacre of 25 Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) jawans in Sukma on Tuesday was a response to **sexual violence by security forces against tribal women, and murder of villagers**.

It was further [said in the audio clip](http://www.indiatvnews.com/news/india-sukma-attack-retaliation-for-2016-encounters-say-maoists-379192) that the attack  was an answer to the Mission 2017, to the state-directed police atrocities on tribals and **"innumerable instances of rape, and gangrapes, of tribal women and girls by security forces.”**

So the rapist and sick souls are punhised.

### TN bandh

In support of farmers a one-day shutdown/bandh is called on Tuesday 25th April by all parties exculuding AIADMK and BJP

Poor rains have left Tamil Nadu battling a severe drought. The government had in January declared all the state’s 32 districts drought-hit and sought help from the Centre.

While shops, hotels downed their shutters in the capital Chennai and other parts of the southern state, government buses were seen on roads. Offices, too, were open.

Cinema halls were closed for the day and the film fraternity expressed its support by cancelling shoots. Staff at fuel stations were wearing black badges.

Outside Chennai, the shutdown got a good response, especially in the Cauvery Delta, the rice bowl of the state. In Thanjavur, most businesses were shut and buses off the road. In Cuddalore private buses and auto rickshaws stayed away while shops were closed in Tirunelveli.

Neighbouring Puducherry, too, joined the protest.

### WannaCry - Ransomware spreads to dozens of countries

May 12, 2017: A ransomware attack seemingly based on leaked NSA hacking tools is spreading like wildfire among unpatched Windows systems worldwide. WannaCry aka WanaCrypt0r 2.0 or WannaCry or WCry, is a **ransomware**. [WannaCry program](https://techcrunch.com/2017/05/13/that-global-ransomware-attack-was-halted-apparently-by-accident/) encrypts your files and demands payment in bitcoin in order to regain access. The broad based ransomware attack has hit as many as 200,000+ victims in over 150 countries.

<iframe width="640" height="390" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/LyErffRX0HM" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

WannaCry exploited a vulnerability in the Windows operating system believed to have been developed by the United States' National Security Agency (NSA), which became public last month. WannaCry exploits a vulnerability in Microsoft and that Microsoft patched this in March. People don't always install updates and patches on their computers and so this means vulnerabilities can remain open a lot longer and make things easier for hackers to get in.

### A grand coup planned to split the Aam Aadmi Party

Its been months some members has been working aginst AAP, buy getting money from BJP. Had it not been for a driver, Arvind Kejriwal may have become the 'former' Chief Minister of Delhi by now. [A grand coup planned to split the Aam Aadmi Party](http://www.oneindia.com/india/how-the-grand-coup-in-aap-to-topple-kejriwal-regime-was-quelled-by-driver/kumar-vishwas-and-kapil-mishra-led-the-coup-pf27004-2435412.html) and force Kejriwal to resign from the Chief Minister's post ended up making its perpetrators the victims, Kapil Mishra being one of them.

) and his sons office/receidents

The agency is examining all Foreign Investment Promotion Board (FIPB) approvals during the period Chidambaram was finance minister, and in which Karti was directly or indirectly involved.

While Chidambaram was finance minister in 2007-08, not only did the FIPB ignore the criminality in the proposal of INX Media, which allegedly paid Rs 3.50 crore to Karti, but "undue favour was shown to the company", the agency said.

It also said Karti influenced finance ministry officials "by virtue of his relationship with the then finance minister".

> "Pakistan is like a well of death", said Uzma Ahmed

Uzma Ahmed, who belongs to New Delhi, and Ali "fell in love" in Malaysia, after which she travelled to Pakistan on May 1, via the Wagah border.

The woman claimed she was forced at gunpoint to marry Buner resident Tahir Ali. She took refuge at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad because she felt threatened, and wanted to return to her country of birth.

Uzma claimed she was forced at gunpoint to marry Buner resident Tahir Ali. During the court hearing, Pakistani judge Justice Mohsin Akhtar Kayani asked Uzma if she wanted to meet her husband in the chamber but she refused the offer, saying she did not want to talk to him. The High Court ordered that Uzma can go back to her country and the case will be processed in her absence.

Uzma travelled to Lahore from Islamabad and was accompanied by Indian Deputy High Commissioner J.P. Singh. She stayed in Pakistan for 25 days. Near the Wagah border she was escorted by Pakistani security personnel. She prostrated and kissed the ground as soon as she entered Indian territory.

She thanked the government of India, particularly External Affairs Minister Sushma Swaraj for making her return possible and making her realize "the value of my life as an Indian citizen".

"I am proud to be an Indian citizen. Sushma madam would call me every day to say we are fighting for you, you are our daughter, you are India's daughter," she said, recounting the days she spent at the Indian High Commission in Islamabad.


> I advise Indian Muslim women not to get married & settled in Pakistan.The women there have no freedom at all.I'm proud being an Indian - Uzma

### Greater Noida gang rape

A man was shot dead and four women of his family were allegedly gang-raped at gunpoint in the early hours of Thursday on the highway near Jewar in Uttar Pradesh, around 68 km from Delhi.

The family of 4 men and 4 women was travelling in a car from Jewar, which is in Greater Noida, to Bulandshahr, to visit a relative in hospital. Their car reportedly stopped after hitting a metal object in the middle of the highway around 1 am.

When some members of the family came out to investigate, six armed men allegedly surrounded the car, dragged the women out and gang-raped them before looting the family. A 45-year-old man was shot dead when he tried to save the women.

Members of the family say before getting out of the car, they called the police for help, suspecting something was wrong. The police still took more than an hour to arrive, they claim.

**Similar to one last year** (2016) near the highway in Bulandshahr, when another family was targeted by a group of armed men. A woman and her 13-year-old daughter were pulled out of the car and gang-raped in the fields while the men of the family were tied up and beaten.

### Election Commission: Do not touch, but prove EVM are hacked

No political party has applied to take part in the EVM tampering challenge of the Election Commission on June 3

> Reason: The conditions put by the Election Commission: The Election Commission has denied us the permission to touch the voting machine.

The Election Commission yesterday [rejected the demand of the AAP](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/aam-aadmi-party-electronic-voting-machine-election-commission/1/963538.html) to allow it to tamper with the motherboard of the machine during the EVM challenge.

Why is the Election Commission running away from organising a no-holds-barred hackathon

> The Election Commission knows that the EVM's can be tampered if allowed.

I think EC expects to do some magic by staring at EVM and hack it.

#### Rampur molestation

A video clip of [two girls being molested](http://www.abplive.in/india-news/rampur-molestation-all-4-prime-accused-arrested-search-on-to-catch-other-accused-says-sp-533003) openly by a group of young men had recently set the social media on fire. The incident happened in Uttar Pradesh's Rampur district.

In the video, around 12 to 14 boys can be seen, molesting the women, even while they pleaded to let them go. The boys filmed the entire development and posted it on social media. The boys were also laughing and making jokes while the distraught girls kept on begging to be spared.

Interestingly, in March, after coming to power in the state, the Yogi Adityanath government launched 'anti-Romeo' squads to check on eve-teasing in public areas, to ensure the safety of girls in the state.

> Today, after three years, I feel miserable and cheated as it was me who convinced our farmer brothers to vote for the BJP, vote for Modi. It was a big mistake that we asked the farmers to vote for the BJP. Hence, as a matter of repentance, we have undertaken this Atmaklesh Yatra. Before starting the march, I apologised to our farmers for this mistake. We have brought the issue to the notice of the Maharashtra chief minister as well as PM Narendra Modi. However, we always received vague replies. This prompted us to start our march against the government. said Shetti.

Nearly 40% of Ayurveda products, including items from Baba Ramdev's Patanjali, were found to be of [substandard quality](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/baba-ramdev-s-patanjali-products-fail-uttarakhand-quality-test/story-bXo4XySEajw7ZDby4GISML.html) by Haridwar's Ayurveda and Unani Office, a Right to Information (RTI) reply revealed.

Out of the 82 samples collected between 2013 and 2016, 32 failed the quality test. Patanjali's Divya Amla Juice and Shivlingi Beej were among the products that failed to meet the quality standards.

Last month, the armed forces' Canteen Stores Department (CSD) had suspended the sale of a batch of Patanjali's amla juice after it 'failed' a quality test carried out at West Bengal Public Health Laboratory.

#### RBI Planning for Bank Account Portablity 

RBI deputy governor S S Mundra was speaking at an event organized by the Banking Codes and Standards Board of India. He said technological innovation and linking accounts to Aadhaar can make it easier for this to happen. 

He also batted for introduction of [bank account number portability](http://www.moneycontrol.com/news/business/economy/some-banks-use-service-charges-to-drive-away-customers-s-s-mundra-2292799.html) using Aadhaar and various platforms of NPCI (National Payments Corporation of India).

Just like your mobile number, you could soon move your account from one bank to another without having to change the account number. 

> "While banks have been granted autonomy in fixing minimum average balance or charging for premier services, it should not be used as an excuse to deny or drive away services to the common man. This is what we are at tend to observe in some of the institutions...it is moving in that direction," Deputy Governor S S Mundra said.

In a 139-page judgment, Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma of the Rajasthan High Court has passed unprecedented directions to declare cow as the national animal of India and its killers be sentenced to life imprisonment.

What if Cow becomes National Animal istead of Tiger? 

Answer is simple, Cow will become extinct animal like tiger. 


#### Peacocks are brahmacharis (celibate)

Peacock is the national bird as it never has sex with peahen, says Rajasthan High Court judge Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma, that means [peacocks are brahmacharis](http://www.firstpost.com/india/watch-rajasthan-hc-judges-remarks-unmask-the-real-alternative-facts-about-the-virtuous-peacocks-3504883.html) (celibate) who impregnate peahens with their tears.

A peacock or a peahen is then born... Lord Krishna used peacock's feather for celibacy of the bird - Rajasthan High Court judge Justice Mahesh Chandra Sharma.

Do you think Indian judiciary is in safe hands ?

#### Cows up for sale online OLX

Hamstrung by the government's restrictions on sale of cattle, farmers and livestock traders have found greener pastures in digital India. So, a swift search on [online marketplaces such as OLX](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/cow-slaughter-beef-ban-gau-rakshak-olx-cattle-sold-online/1/967924.html) shows that hundreds of cows are up for sale in the virtual world.

The environment ministry decreed last week that animal markets could only trade cattle for agricultural purposes, such as ploughing and dairy production. The rule came as part of a tough new law against 

It's not that cows have not been sold on e-commerce websites before. They have been available occasionally under the pets section. But there has been a sudden surge since the BJP swept to power in Uttar Pradesh in March with priest-turned politician Yogi Adityanath taking the chief minister's post, and the rise of the gau rakshaks, or cow vigilantes.

#### India GDP growth enters slow lane in Q4 at 6.1%

India’s economic growth fell to 6.1 per cent in the fourth quarter (Q4) of 2016-17 (FY17), primarily [because of demonetisation](http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/demonetisation-effect-gdp-growth-enters-slow-lane-in-q4-at-6-1-117053101684_1.html) adversely affecting economic activity. This was at least a four-quarter low. 

The sectors worst affected were construction and financial services. The effect of demonetisation was evident in the figures, with growth being pushed primarily by agriculture and government spending. 

6.1 GDP growth for FY17 includes government consumption, without which real GDP growth is just 5.6 per cent, much lower than an average growth of 7.2 per cent in the previous four years. 

<img src="http://bsmedia.business-standard.com/_media/bs/img/article/2017-06/01/full/1496261880-1571.jpg" width="640">

GDP over quaters of 2016-17

* Q1 - 7.9
* Q2 - 7.5
* Q3 - 7.0
* Q4 - 6.1

If India has to emerge as the manufacturing, economic powerhouse in the Asia, competing with China, it needs to grow much more than the 7 percent mark, create more jobs and facilitate investments. 

Modi Govt would have done well acknowledging the impact of demonetisation on the economy and take corrective measures **instead of being in denial mode**. His admission that demonetisation was performed on the economy that was already fighting a slowdown directly contradicts the claim of his boss who said economy was doing well at that point and was ready for a surgery.

We have some of the biggest problems that needs to be addresed like, 

- Close PSU's that are making loss
- Create local jobs
- Admit there is problem and work towards solving it
- Beyond passing a bankruptcy law, Govt did nothing
- The most important, stop politicising and blame game, work towards progress you will voted back next time

Also the stock market is now lunatic, creates a bubble ready to explode mostly powered by local investors. 

Warning: There is well known speed breaker ahead, GST roll out

#### Moody’s - India's debt level is significantly higher

India's debt level is "significantly" [higher compared with similarly rated countries](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/economy/indicators/indias-debt-remains-significantly-high-higher-than-bahamas-and-south-africa-says-moodys/articleshow/58941399.cms), Moody’s Investor Service said

Rating agencies have India just above **junk** status. Moody’s said that while the general government debt level declined to 67.5 percent of GDP in 2016 from 84.7 percent in 2003, it remains a key credit constraint.

Moody’s notes that India’s debt burden is higher than most of its Baa peers including the Bahamas and South Africa. (Baa is medium-grade credit risk). Moody’s India rating is at Baa3, the lowest on that rung.

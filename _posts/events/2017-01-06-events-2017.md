### Bengaluru molestation on the New Year Eve Celebration

> In midnight, men in the crowd (~ one lakh+) simply went nuts. Bengaluru’s depraved men started pawing and groping at any girl they could get their hands on. Women ran for their lives.

Since 90s every year incidents of girls being molested have occurred almost every year with unfailing regularity the perpetrators have never been caught. This time in 2017 its a **MASS MOLESTATION**, there is every indication that the perverts will get away with it.

Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh, posted in 42 Infantry Brigade in Dehradun, said that after he wrote to the prime minister, the defence minister, the president and the Supreme Court in June last year, his brigade received a communication from PMO asking for a probe into his grievances.

He said when the Prime Minister’s Office wrote back to the Brigade asking it to investigate the matter, “the Brigadier put pressure on me and tortured me to such a level that I could have taken an extreme step. But I will not commit suicide or act in any way or against anyone that will tarnish the name of my service,” he said.

The video has come to light as two similar clips have been trending on social media.

* In one of the videos, a CRPF constable demanded parity in pay and other benefits between the army and the paramilitary forces, citing the difficult assignments they had to undertake.
* In the other video, a BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav has complained about [poor quality food served](http://www.firstpost.com/india/bsf-jawan-tej-bahadur-yadavs-video-is-not-about-a-diet-problem-it-reflects-a-deeper-malaise-3201720.html) to them in icy weather condition on the border in Jammu and Kashmir.

> No amount of lipstick can make pig look better.
> No amount of fake patriotism can hide the fact that our armed forces, BSF and CRPF are as rotten as the rest of the society!

### PM Modi Replaces Mahatma Gandhi On Khadi Calendar

PM Modi triggered a flurry of reactions after reports emerged that his photograph had replaced an iconic shot of Mahatma Gandhi with his spinning wheel, on the new Khadi Udyog merchandise.

The PM’s photograph -- which was published on the cover pages of the Khadi Village Industries Commission’s (KVIC) 2017 calendar and diary -- shows Modi weaving khadi on a large ‘charkha’, in the same classic pose as Gandhi.

The decision, however, did not sit well with everyone.

Mohsin was brutally beaten and was left bleeding and unconscious on the road; his friend escaped.

Three of the 21 arrested (Vijay Rajendra Gambhire, Ranjeet Shankar Yadav and Ajay Dilip Lalge) - were granted bail on 12-Jan-2016 by the Bombay High Court, which says they were "PROVOKED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION AND THEY COMMITTED MURDER."

HC judge **Mridula Bhatkar** [said in her order](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/provoked-over-religion-says-judge-giving-bail-to-muslim-mans-killers-1649602)

> "The fault of the deceased was only that he belonged to another religion. I consider this factor in favour of the accused. Moreover, the accused do not have any criminal record and it appears that in the name of the religion, they were provoked and have committed the murder".

**Lesson learnt**

The protesters demanded is one

> that the chief minister issue a statement to clarify the state's position on the Jallikattu issue and added that the protest will not cease until such a time.

It looks like [Tamil Nadu version of the Arab Spring](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-witnessing-mass-students-uprising-for-jallikattu/articleshow/56641218.cms), or it may even remind you of the anti-Hindi agitation in the state in the 1960s. It is happening students and youngsters are on the roads and public places demanding the conduct of jallikattu, the traditional bull-taming sport in the state.

> Nothing will happen to the accused, as Corrupt Police and Money licking Judiciary will support him.

### Colonel Nizamuddin, Netaji's trusted friend, dies at 117

Not many have heard about Colonel Nizamuddin, one of the many foot-soldiers from Indian freedom struggle, who died as an unsung hero on Monday morning. On Tuesday, media reports say Nizamuddin died at the age of 117 in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh.

Born in 1901, Nizamuddin is survived by his wife Ajbul Nisha, three sons and two daughters. His youngest son Sheikh Akram was by his side when the end came in the early hours today. Nizamuddin, who had served in the Indian National Army from 1943-45. Nizamuddin fought for the country's freedom in Singapore and Burma (now Myanmar) as a soldier in Netaji's Indian National Army (INA).

He was the trusted driver and bodyguard of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Nizamuddin was the same man who took three bullets to save Netaji in the forests of Burma, according to a report published by The Telegraph.

He accompanied Bose during his meeting with Hitler to seek help to secure freedom for India. He also accompanied Bose during his trips to Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

He insisted he was Jayalalithaa's choice for the chief ministerial position and that Sasikala and her supporters threatened and forced him to resign from the CM post.

> "I will withdraw my resignation, if people wish... I would fight to save the party and the goodwill of Jayalalithaa's legacy," he said.

The scenario is very similar to the winter of 1987-88 following the death of MGR, similar war errupted between Janaki Ramachandran, widow of the late MGR, and Jayalalithaa. We have to wait and watch.

> We, the faculty members of the English Department, Lady Shri Ram College unequivocally and strongly support our student Gurmehar Kaur and her right to express her opinion on issues that embroil our university. It is immensely gratifying to us as her teachers that she has responded sensitively, creatively and bravely to events in her immediate context rather than seek the safe refuge of silence.
> We feel that it is the bounden duty of educational institutions to nurture sensitive, responsive and critical thinking students without the fear of violent retaliation.

### Tamil Nadu trade bodies to bycott Pepsi, Coca-Cola

Tamil Nadu Traders Federation (TNTF) and Consortium of Tamil Nadu Traders Association (CTNTA) have urged the traders in the state to shun Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and promote regional brands, Kali Mark, Bovonto and Torino, from **1 March**. This move is partly inspired by the jallikkattu protests, which have also been viewed as assertion of the state's cultural freedom.

Good Job! but on 2nd March The Madras High Court lifted a ban on Coca Cola and Pepsi from using River Tamirparani's water in Tamil Nadu. The cola giants were stopped from using the river water after protests, four months ago.
The argument against the companies were that thousands of farmers are suffering because the river water is being used for commercial gain. The companies, however, said that the water used in manufacturing cola was the surplus.

### Hard work is more powerful than Harvard - says Prime Minister Narendra Modi

At an election rally in Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday, in an apparent dig at economists who have criticised the government’s demonetisation move.

> On the one hand are those (critics of note ban) who talk of what people at Harvard say and on the other hand is a poor man’s son who through his hard work is trying to improve the economy - [Prime Minister Narendra Modi](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7Hxx3U5JmdXn0txK0pZu8L/Hard-work-more-powerful-than-Harvard-says-Narendra-Modi.html)

Modi's brings recent GDP figures released by the Central Statistics Office as a proof. Indian economy grew by 7.0% in the December quarter, indicating that the impact of demonetisation was negligible on economic growth.

This clearly shows PM does not know what is GDP, some one needs to explain him what is GDP.

But Pronab Sen, the former Secretary of the Statistics Ministry, points out,

> the GDP data is collected at the factory level but did not capture the inventories lying idle at automobile showrooms, departmental stores and other retail outlets.
> the GDP figures for the January-March quarter will probably reflect the disruption caused by demonetisation more accurately
> you can only push out so much inventory but if it is piling up in retail stores and not being sold, the factories won’t be able to send out manufactured products. - Pronab Sen told News18,

the real output will come in the up comming quarters

### Dhoni Aadhar details on social media.

Former India captain Mahendra Singh Dhoni’s [Aadhaar details were made public by a Twitter handle](http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/ms-dhonis-aadhaar-leak-raises-questions-on-data-safety-and-privacy-4590997/) of the Central Services Centre. The leak has raised the issue of privacy of individuals and security of data collected by the government for Aadhaar. The government has been on an overdrive to implement Aadhaar and link it to both welfare and non-welfare schemes in the country. But, it is a serious concern when personal information of an individual is not kept secure and leaked out in the public domain. Despite implementing advanced technological safeguards, a thing as simple as human error breached the security of Aadhaar. Perhaps the focus should be on ensuring complete safety to Aadhaar data, at the collection points as well as storage repositories, instead of showing urgency to impose it on citizens.

Furthermore, there are security loopholes which are continuously being flagged but instead of paying heed to them and resolving the issues, the government seems to be in denial. In recent reports, it was seen how people were able to gain more than one Aadhaar enrollment IDs. Social media is littered with posts, some claiming to be evidence, of more extensive security vulnerabilities or compromise of Aadhaar.

### EVM votes only for one party

An Electronic Voting Machine that was reported to have voted for a particular party during a demonstration in Madhya Pradesh on Saturday reignited the opposition charge that [tampered EVMs](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/evm-in-madhya-pradesh-votes-just-for-bjp-says-opposition-seeking-probe-1676116) had helped the BJP in the last round of assembly elections.

### Begging is a crime in 20 Indian states and 2 union territories.

You're under arrest for 'looking poor': Indians in 20 states, 2 union territories can be arrested for begging

I didn't know that, Many state laws treat begging within the jurisdiction of court and as a non-bailable offense. Most state laws allow the police to arrest anyone they think is a beggar without a warrant, [Hindustan Times](http://www.hindustantimes.com/india-news/you-can-be-arrested-for-looking-poor-in-most-indian-states-and-union-territories/story-Tvssf0mLY7NnVFvApYy5XO.html) reported.

Except in the state of Tamil Nadu and Assam, most of the state laws take into account the fact that not having means to sustain a livelihood or if the person is wandering, he's a beggar.

Laws in India legitimately grant the police the [authority to arrest beggars](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/looking-poor-people-20-states-2-union-territories-arrested-begging/1/918198.html), that too without a warrant.

### Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's Press Conference Highlights

Here are the live updates of Delhi Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal's press conference:
* The law says you can't move the EVMs 45 days after polls.
* What was the compulsion of the EC to blatantly break the law and move the Kanpur machine to Bhind?
* That means there can be other machines that also took votes just for the BJP.
* Earlier when EVMs were tampered, you could see if your vote went to other party, thanks to the light.
* Now they have tweaked the software so much that the light is correct but the vote goes to the wrong party.
* It also appears that not all machines but some machines were tampered and they were placed critically.
* The EC says the software of EMVs are not over-writable. We want these machines handed to us and we will get it tested by our own experts.
* This is a matter of the entire country's faith. It raises serious questions on the EC's integrity.
* All elections are under threat. People will lose their faith in the voting system.
* Deputy Chief Minister Manish Sisodia: The EC needs to investigate why the machine that came from UP, voted for BJP no matter which button you pressed. Questions have been raised on the EC's intent. Look at how that officer bullied reporters, threatening them with locking them up in the jail. Advanced countries all over the world have rejected EVMs. Why? This is not a malfunction. This is an intentional bug that has been added to the machine.
* Chief Minister Arvind Kejriwal: We are challenging the EC. EC says software cannot be overwritten. We challenge them: Under camera, in presence of your officers, give us the machines for 72 hours - we will show you how the software can be overwritten.
* Its not about our josh. It is about the faith of the people. People are asking me why should we vote if our votes aren't counted. There is no other way than going back to paper ballots. Democracy is under threat.

Khan was planning to buy a milch buffalo when he set out from Mewat to Jaipur last Friday. As a dairy farmer, he wanted to increase the production of milk during Ramadan. But on Saturday, Khan bought a milch cow instead, as the seller extracted **12 litres of mil**k in front of him, and offered to sell the cow for a reasonable price.

A Documents accessed by [India Today](http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/alwar-gau-rakshak-attack-murder-cattle-farm-owner-pehlu-khan/1/921761.html) had earlier showed that Khan had **valid Jaipur Municipal Corporation receipts** to transport cattle and that he was not in fact smuggling cows.

The five men were also **robbed of their wallets and cellphones**. Irshad reportedly had about Rs 75,000 while another person lost about Rs 35,000.

Are they not terrorits, but they are called Cow Protectors/Gau rakshaks ?

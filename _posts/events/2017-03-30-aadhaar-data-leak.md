Congress created Aadhaar, BJP opposed it. But now BJP pushes it everywhere.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley  has admitted that Aadhaar was a **great initiative** of the [previous UPA government](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/finance-minister-admits-that-aadhaar-was-a-great-initiative-from-congress-lead-upa-government-369539.html)

This may be the [first leak of Aadhaar information online](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/a-simple-google-search-delivers-databases-with-aadhaar-numbers-but-aadhaar-is-not-compromised-368561.html#NewNavTop), that make the privacy of many hang in the air. More and big should come in the upcoming time.

Privacy is a fundamental human right, and has been declared so by the [United Nations](https://www.un.org/en/universal-declaration-human-rights/).

### Aadhaar leaked online, you can search it with Google

I am convinced Aadhaar, is one of the biggest security/privacy hole, checkout this [Medium article](https://medium.com/@St_Hill/i-wrote-a-few-words-about-aadhaar-34e141afb725), it list most important flaws in the Aadhaar card.

The [Aadhaar databases are available on Google](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/a-simple-google-search-delivers-databases-with-aadhaar-numbers-but-aadhaar-is-not-compromised-368561.html) searches for strings such as

```aadhaar name filetype:xls -uidai```

**[or]**

```passport name filetype:xls```

**[or]**

```aadhaar name filetype:xls inurl:gov.in -uidai```

The first search will deliver databases with passport details from Google, and the second with databases which contain Aadhaar numbers.

The personal data involved includes beneficiary name, address, gender, family details, Aadhaar number and bank details (account number, IFSC code), contact number, etc.

More the data is linked to Aadhaar, more are the changes of exposure.

One particular state government, that administers a national welfare scheme for minors, has published the names, addresses, genders, religion, caste and bank account details (account number and IFSC code) for hundreds of minors.

Yet another state government department has available online a list of “trainees” that includes personal details such as caste, gender and religion.

Another particularly troubling case includes a state government publishing a Microsoft Excel sheet that contains the Aadhaar card and bank account details of over 1 lakh state residents who are part of a social development programme initiative.

The most important leaks are [from Central and State Govt](https://thewire.in/118250/government-expose-personal-data-thousands-indians/)


### Someone else is pushing

Congress created Aadhaar, BJP opposed it. But now BJP pushes it everywhere.

Finance Minister Arun Jaitley  has admitted that Aadhaar was a **great initiative** of the [previous UPA government](http://tech.firstpost.com/news-analysis/finance-minister-admits-that-aadhaar-was-a-great-initiative-from-congress-lead-upa-government-369539.html)

I suspect third country has its hand, read [this article](https://medium.freecodecamp.com/how-to-set-up-a-vpn-in-5-minutes-for-free-and-why-you-urgently-need-one-d5cdba361907?r=e) you will get what I am thinking. Every where around the globle there are some who despritly need of our personal data, may be its India or US or else, the rule is same.

### Conclusion

Since its inception, Aadhaar has been criticised as a project which violates privacy. India does not have a law on privacy. In fact, then chairman of UIDAI, Nandan Nilekani, wrote to the Prime Minister as early as in May 2010 suggesting that there was a need to have a [data protection and privacy law](http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/op-ed/is-aadhaar-a-breach-of-privacy/article17745615.ece).

Now it will be very easy to put you behind the bars, with only meta data, like you made N number of call to this number without knowing the content, no one may care what you spoke over the call.

It may be easy and convinent, but use Aadhar less as possible. Most of the time avoid it.

A boat docked in a tiny Mexican village. An American tourist complimented the Mexican fisherman on the quality of his fish and asked how long it took him to catch them. The fisherman said...

Not very long.

Well, then, why didn't you stay out longer and catch more?

Because this is sufficient to meet my needs and those of my family.

But what do you do with the rest of your time?

I sleep late, fish a little, play with my children, and take a siesta with my wife. In the evenings, I go into the village to see my friends, have a few drinks, play the guitar, and sing a few songs, and socialise with my friends... I have a full life.

The American interrupted and said I am an MBA and an investment banker and I can help you! You should start by fishing longer every day.

You can then sell the extra fish you catch. With the extra revenue, you can buy a bigger boat. With the extra money the larger boat will bring, you can buy a second one and a third one and so on until you have an entire fleet of trawlers.

Instead of selling your fish to a middle man, you can negotiate directly with the processing plants and maybe even open your own plant. You can then leave this little village and move to Mexico City, Los Angeles, or even New York City! From there you can direct your huge enterprise.

How long would that take?

Twenty, perhaps twenty-five years.

And then what after that?

After that, you can live like a king in your own house, and when the time is right, you can go public and float your shares in the stock exchange. By then, you will be rich. Your income will be coming in by the millions!

Millions? Really? And then what after that?

Ah, that is the beauty part of all this. After that you'll be able to retire, live in a tiny village near the coast, sleep late, play with your children, catch a few fish, take siestas with your wife, and spend your evenings playing the guitar, singing a few songs, drinking, and socialising with your friends...

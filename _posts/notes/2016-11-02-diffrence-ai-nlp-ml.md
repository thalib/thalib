excerpt: Difference between Artificial intelligence, Machine Learning, Natural Language Processing
---

Two phrases in particular, though, are often incorrectly used as an alternative to AI: Natural Language Processing (**NLP**) and Machine Learning (**ML**).

To clarify the differences between them, hereâ€™s a (very) short (and easy-to-remember) summary:

* **AI** = systems that can do intelligent things
* **NLP = systems that can understand language; NLP is considered a strict subset of AI
* **ML** = systems that can learn from experience; ML is a strict subset of AI
* **NLP with ML** = systems that can improve upon their understanding of language(s)

### DON'T: Avoid tracking large files in your repo

Avoid putting large files into your repository: binaries, media files, archived artifacts, etc.

This is because once you add a file, it will always be there in the repoâ€™s history, which means every time the repo is cloned, that huge heavy file will be cloned along with it.

### DO: Use shallow clones

By default Git clones the repos entire history, this takes longer and longer. If you don't need all history then use shallow clone ```--depth 1``` .

```
git clone --depth 1 https://git.kernel.org/pub/scm/linux/kernel/git/torvalds/linux.git
```

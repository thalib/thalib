### Bengaluru molestation on the New Year Eve Celebration

> In midnight, men in the crowd (~ one lakh+) simply went nuts. Bengaluru’s depraved men started pawing and groping at any girl they could get their hands on. Women ran for their lives.

Since 90s every year incidents of girls being molested have occurred almost every year with unfailing regularity the perpetrators have never been caught. This time in 2017 its a **MASS MOLESTATION**, there is every indication that the perverts will get away with it.

Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh, posted in 42 Infantry Brigade in Dehradun, said that after he wrote to the prime minister, the defence minister, the president and the Supreme Court in June last year, his brigade received a communication from PMO asking for a probe into his grievances.

He said when the Prime Minister’s Office wrote back to the Brigade asking it to investigate the matter, “the Brigadier put pressure on me and tortured me to such a level that I could have taken an extreme step. But I will not commit suicide or act in any way or against anyone that will tarnish the name of my service,” he said.

The video has come to light as two similar clips have been trending on social media.

* In one of the videos, a CRPF constable demanded parity in pay and other benefits between the army and the paramilitary forces, citing the difficult assignments they had to undertake.
* In the other video, a BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav has complained about [poor quality food served](http://www.firstpost.com/india/bsf-jawan-tej-bahadur-yadavs-video-is-not-about-a-diet-problem-it-reflects-a-deeper-malaise-3201720.html) to them in icy weather condition on the border in Jammu and Kashmir.

> No amount of lipstick can make pig look better.
> No amount of fake patriotism can hide the fact that our armed forces, BSF and CRPF are as rotten as the rest of the society!

### PM Modi Replaces Mahatma Gandhi On Khadi Calendar

PM Modi triggered a flurry of reactions after reports emerged that his photograph had replaced an iconic shot of Mahatma Gandhi with his spinning wheel, on the new Khadi Udyog merchandise.

The PM’s photograph -- which was published on the cover pages of the Khadi Village Industries Commission’s (KVIC) 2017 calendar and diary -- shows Modi weaving khadi on a large ‘charkha’, in the same classic pose as Gandhi.

The decision, however, did not sit well with everyone.

Three of the 21 arrested (Vijay Rajendra Gambhire, Ranjeet Shankar Yadav and Ajay Dilip Lalge) - were granted bail on 12-Jan-2016 by the Bombay High Court, which says they were "PROVOKED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION AND THEY COMMITTED MURDER."

HC judge **Mridula Bhatkar** [said in her order](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/provoked-over-religion-says-judge-giving-bail-to-muslim-mans-killers-1649602)

> "The fault of the deceased was only that he belonged to another religion. I consider this factor in favour of the accused. Moreover, the accused do not have any criminal record and it appears that in the name of the religion, they were provoked and have committed the murder".

**Lesson learnt**

The protesters demanded is one

> that the chief minister issue a statement to clarify the state's position on the Jallikattu issue and added that the protest will not cease until such a time.

It looks like [Tamil Nadu version of the Arab Spring](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-witnessing-mass-students-uprising-for-jallikattu/articleshow/56641218.cms), or it may even remind you of the anti-Hindi agitation in the state in the 1960s. It is happening students and youngsters are on the roads and public places demanding the conduct of jallikattu, the traditional bull-taming sport in the state.

> Nothing will happen to the accused, as Corrupt Police and Money licking Judiciary will support him.

### Colonel Nizamuddin, Netaji's trusted friend, dies at 117

Not many have heard about Colonel Nizamuddin, one of the many foot-soldiers from Indian freedom struggle, who died as an unsung hero on Monday morning. On Tuesday, media reports say Nizamuddin died at the age of 117 in Azamgarh district of Uttar Pradesh.

Born in 1901, Nizamuddin is survived by his wife Ajbul Nisha, three sons and two daughters. His youngest son Sheikh Akram was by his side when the end came in the early hours today. Nizamuddin, who had served in the Indian National Army from 1943-45. Nizamuddin fought for the country's freedom in Singapore and Burma (now Myanmar) as a soldier in Netaji's Indian National Army (INA).

He was the trusted driver and bodyguard of Netaji Subhas Chandra Bose. Nizamuddin was the same man who took three bullets to save Netaji in the forests of Burma, according to a report published by The Telegraph.

He accompanied Bose during his meeting with Hitler to seek help to secure freedom for India. He also accompanied Bose during his trips to Japan, Thailand, Malaysia and Singapore.

He insisted he was Jayalalithaa's choice for the chief ministerial position and that Sasikala and her supporters threatened and forced him to resign from the CM post.

> "I will withdraw my resignation, if people wish... I would fight to save the party and the goodwill of Jayalalithaa's legacy," he said.

The scenario is very similar to the winter of 1987-88 following the death of MGR, similar war errupted between Janaki Ramachandran, widow of the late MGR, and Jayalalithaa. We have to wait and watch.

> We, the faculty members of the English Department, Lady Shri Ram College unequivocally and strongly support our student Gurmehar Kaur and her right to express her opinion on issues that embroil our university. It is immensely gratifying to us as her teachers that she has responded sensitively, creatively and bravely to events in her immediate context rather than seek the safe refuge of silence.
> We feel that it is the bounden duty of educational institutions to nurture sensitive, responsive and critical thinking students without the fear of violent retaliation.

### Tamil Nadu trade bodies to bycott Pepsi, Coca-Cola

Tamil Nadu Traders Federation (TNTF) and Consortium of Tamil Nadu Traders Association (CTNTA) have urged the traders in the state to shun Coca-Cola and Pepsi, and promote regional brands, Kali Mark, Bovonto and Torino, from **1 March**.

Good Job! but on 2nd March The Madras High Court lifted a ban on Coca Cola and Pepsi from using River Tamirparani's water in Tamil Nadu. The cola giants were stopped from using the river water after protests, four months ago.
The argument against the companies were that thousands of farmers are suffering because the river water is being used for commercial gain. The companies, however, said that the water used in manufacturing cola was the surplus.

### Hard work is more powerful than Harvard - says Prime Minister Narendra Modi

At an election rally in Maharajganj, Uttar Pradesh, on Wednesday, in an apparent dig at economists who have criticised the government’s demonetisation move.

> On the one hand are those (critics of note ban) who talk of what people at Harvard say and on the other hand is a poor man’s son who through his hard work is trying to improve the economy - [Prime Minister Narendra Modi](http://www.livemint.com/Politics/7Hxx3U5JmdXn0txK0pZu8L/Hard-work-more-powerful-than-Harvard-says-Narendra-Modi.html)

Modi's brings recent GDP figures released by the Central Statistics Office as a proof. Indian economy grew by 7.0% in the December quarter, indicating that the impact of demonetisation was negligible on economic growth.

This clearly shows PM does not know what is GDP, some one needs to explain him what is GDP.

But Pronab Sen, the former Secretary of the Statistics Ministry, points out,

> the GDP data is collected at the factory level but did not capture the inventories lying idle at automobile showrooms, departmental stores and other retail outlets.
> the GDP figures for the January-March quarter will probably reflect the disruption caused by demonetisation more accurately
> you can only push out so much inventory but if it is piling up in retail stores and not being sold, the factories won’t be able to send out manufactured products. - Pronab Sen told News18,

the real output will come in the up comming quarters

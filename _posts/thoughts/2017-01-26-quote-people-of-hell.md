> All those who are violent, arrogant and stubborn are the people of hell

Narrated Haritha bin Wahb Al-Khuzai (Radi-Allahu 'anhu):

I heard the Prophet (Sallallahu 'Alaihi Wa Sallam) saying. "May I tell you of the people of Paradise? They are every weak, poor and obscure person whom the people look down upon but when he takes an oath to do something, his oath is fulfilled by Allah. And may I inform you of the people of the Hell-Fire? They are all those violent, arrogant and stubborn people." (Bukhari Vol. 6 : No. 440)

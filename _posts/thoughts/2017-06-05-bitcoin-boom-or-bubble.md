Bitcoin is up many fold in just one year

* INR 167099 = 1 Bitcoin (June 6, 2017)
* INR 39130 = 1 Bitcoin (June 6, 2016)

Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are valuation has skyrocketted just in few months, but where does its value come from. The important thing to watch is how usefull it is to user. 

Because if nobody is using Bitcoin for transacation, then Cryptocurrencies are valued as worthless.

Cryptocurrencies are yet to get main stream adoptation, like anyother technlogy it can take off or crash, for some time cryptocurrencies are not a viable option to invest.

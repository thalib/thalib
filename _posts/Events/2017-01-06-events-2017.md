## January 2017

### Bengaluru molestation on the New Year Eve Celebration

> In midnight, men in the crowd (~ one lakh+) simply went nuts. Bengaluru’s depraved men started pawing and groping at any girl they could get their hands on. Women ran for their lives.

Since 90s every year incidents of girls being molested have occurred almost every year with unfailing regularity the perpetrators have never been caught. This time in 2017 its a **MASS MOLESTATION**, there is every indication that the perverts will get away with it.

### Rohingya Masacare

The [photograph of a baby](http://www.huffingtonpost.in/2017/01/05/what-the-heartbreaking-photograph-of-a-rohingya-muslim-boy-tell/), belonging to the Rohingya Muslim community of Myanmar, shared on social media recently, is one of them. Its just enough to explain the ground reality.

### Ill treatment and harassment of BSF and CRPF, Army soldries

[Army jawan tortured](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/after-bsf-and-crpf-jawan-army-jawan-complains-about-harassment-by-seniors-in-new-video-4471952/) for wiriting complaint  to PMO

Lance Naik Yagya Pratap Singh, posted in 42 Infantry Brigade in Dehradun, said that after he wrote to the prime minister, the defence minister, the president and the Supreme Court in June last year, his brigade received a communication from PMO asking for a probe into his grievances.

He said when the Prime Minister’s Office wrote back to the Brigade asking it to investigate the matter, “the Brigadier put pressure on me and tortured me to such a level that I could have taken an extreme step. But I will not commit suicide or act in any way or against anyone that will tarnish the name of my service,” he said.

The video has come to light as two similar clips have been trending on social media.

* In one of the videos, a CRPF constable demanded parity in pay and other benefits between the army and the paramilitary forces, citing the difficult assignments they had to undertake.
* In the other video, a BSF constable Tej Bahadur Yadav has complained about [poor quality food served](http://www.firstpost.com/india/bsf-jawan-tej-bahadur-yadavs-video-is-not-about-a-diet-problem-it-reflects-a-deeper-malaise-3201720.html) to them in icy weather condition on the border in Jammu and Kashmir.

> No amount of lipstick can make pig look better.
> No amount of fake patriotism can hide the fact that our armed forces, BSF and CRPF are as rotten as the rest of the society!

Here is the highlight

### PM Modi Replaces Mahatma Gandhi On Khadi Calendar

PM Modi triggered a flurry of reactions after reports emerged that his photograph had replaced an iconic shot of Mahatma Gandhi with his spinning wheel, on the new Khadi Udyog merchandise.

The PM’s photograph -- which was published on the cover pages of the Khadi Village Industries Commission’s (KVIC) 2017 calendar and diary -- shows Modi weaving khadi on a large ‘charkha’, in the same classic pose as Gandhi.

The decision, however, did not sit well with everyone.

### History Judgment by HC - "PROVOKED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION AND THEY COMMITTED MURDER."

Mohsin Shaikh was allegedly targeted over a Facebook post on Shivaji and Shiv Sena founder Bal Thackeray.

On June 2, 28-year-old Mohsin Shaikh was on his way to dinner with a friend when they were dragged off their motorbike by a group of men (members of Hindu Rashtra Sena) armed with hockey sticks, bats and stones. Mohsin was brutally beaten and was left bleeding and unconscious on the road; his friend escaped.

Three of the 21 arrested (Vijay Rajendra Gambhire, Ranjeet Shankar Yadav and Ajay Dilip Lalge) - were granted bail on 12-Jan-2016 by the Bombay High Court, which says they were "PROVOKED IN THE NAME OF RELIGION AND THEY COMMITTED MURDER."

HC judge **Mridula Bhatkar** [said in her order](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/provoked-over-religion-says-judge-giving-bail-to-muslim-mans-killers-1649602)

> "The fault of the deceased was only that he belonged to another religion. I consider this factor in favour of the accused. Moreover, the accused do not have any criminal record and it appears that in the name of the religion, they were provoked and have committed the murder".

**Lesson learnt**

> Do NOT trust legal system

The protesters demanded is one

> that the chief minister issue a statement to clarify the state's position on the Jallikattu issue and added that the protest will not cease until such a time.

It looks like [Tamil Nadu version of the Arab Spring](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-witnessing-mass-students-uprising-for-jallikattu/articleshow/56641218.cms), or it may even remind you of the anti-Hindi agitation in the state in the 1960s. It is happening students and youngsters are on the roads and public places demanding the conduct of jallikattu, the traditional bull-taming sport in the state.

This year Pongal2017 was diffrent for diffrent location, some placess where peoples were not allowed to conduct Jallikattu, some where small violence and lathi charge.

This is almost second similar incident, perviouly a speeding car rammed into a Autorixa and killed every one.

Delhi Police has said that Shoaib Kohli (a 24-year-old analyst with a multinational food firm based in Gurgaon) was driving his BMW car at a speed of at least 100 kph when he crashed into an Uber cab killing its driver in south Delhi on Sunday. Kohli, a 24-year-old analyst with a multinational food firm based in Gurgaon, was arrested on Monday afternoon from his home in Panchsheel Park. He was released on bail late in the night.

The accused (Shoaib Kohli) was driving BMW at a speed of 100-125 kph while the WagonR was barely moving at 40-50 kph. That stretch of the road is not such that you can drive at a high speed

WagonR driver, Nazrul Islam (32), was found dead after the crash near Munirka flyover around 11.30pm on Sunday. Even as the locals gathered to revive Islam, Kohli managed to flee from the spot in an auto-rickshaw, leaving behind his mangled car.

> Nothing will happen to the accused, as Corrupt Police and Money licking Judiciary will support him.

“We don’t want them here,” Mr. Trump said of Islamist terrorists during a signing ceremony at the Pentagon. “We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country, and love deeply our people.”

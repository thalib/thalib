## October 2016

### Yet another FAKE encounter and prison break drama

In the history this incident will be know as #BhopalEncounter or #SIMIEncounter, the police version is that eight SIMI members booked in different case locked in Bhopal prison, killed a guard and escaped from prison. Later all were gunned down by MP Police's anti-terror unit.

Jail officials claim

The **IMPORTANT** point is that
* all eight members of SIMI were under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**.
* NEWS,  MEDIA and POLITICIAN were ready to pass judgment as these peoples are TERRORIST, because they are **Muslims**

**Here is why fake encounter is for?**

* BJP Rules Madhya Pradesh
* CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is fed up with feeding CHICKEN BIRYANI in jail
* Some thing fishy, because jawan was kill in [Thirudan Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirudan_Police) movie style.
* The case against 8 peoples don't have evidence(FAKE), So the case may be dismissed by the court.
* The MP Police to hide their fault has to kill them.
* The youths were **Muslims**

The sad thing is one jawan and eighth innocent youth were killed (they under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**), the case will be now easily closed.

## November 2016

### Tamil Nadu state enters 60th Year (Diamond jubilee)

On November 1st, 2016 is 60th Year (Diamond jubilee) of Tamil Nadu State formation.

The Tamils didn't in the mood to celebrate it, because most don't know the history about it. At a time when neighboring Kerala and Karnataka are celebrating the day.

The government should honor those people who have made sacrifices during the *frontier struggles* just like honoring those engaged in Independence struggle.

### Ex-Serviceman Committed Suicide over Pension

The 70-year-old ex-serviceman Ram Kishan Grewal from Haryana's Bhiwani district who served in the Army and the Defense Security Corps for 30 years, committed suicide by consuming poison over the issue of One Rank One Pension scheme (OROP).

Shame on the Govt, and their dirty politics. This is how we honor the hero's who sacrificed their time and life for the country. As usual the blame game started between politicians.

### Donald Trump becomes 45th US President

Donald Trump was elected as the 45th U.S. president in the 2016 election, defeating Hillary Clinton. At 70 years old, Trump will be the oldest person to assume the presidency.

### Denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000

In a surprise late evening move on 8th November 2016, prime minister Narendra Modi told the nation in a TV address, that come midnight, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes will no longer be legal tender. You need to exchange these old notes for new one Rs 500 and Rs 2000 before 31st December 2016.

I guess Reliance Jio made the service as free till December 31st, 2016. Sounds logic.

### Zakir Naik's Organization IRF banned for 5 years

15th November, the fascist government banned IRF for 5 years.

Terming it as 'unlawful,' the Union Cabinet today decided to ban Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's NGO IRF (Islamic Research Foundation) for 5 years.

The ban has been enforced under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and was approved at a meeting of the Union Cabinet.

The Hidhutuva groups can't win him in debates, so the decided to ban IRF totally. Thus they they think they have stopped people know about the true Islam. The reverse should will happen, more people will accept the straight path.

## October 2016

### Yet another FAKE encounter and prison break drama

In the history this incident will be know as #BhopalEncounter or #SIMIEncounter, the police version is that eight SIMI members booked in different case locked in Bhopal prison, killed a guard and escaped from prison. Later all were gunned down by MP Police's anti-terror unit.

Jail officials claim

* **bedsheets** were used to scaled a wall nearly **30-feet** high
* Opened the locks by using **toothbrushes** as **keys**.
* Security cameras were **NOT** working (in high-security prison where SIMI prisoners locked up)

The **IMPORTANT** point is that
* all eight members of SIMI were under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**.
* NEWS,  MEDIA and POLITICIAN were ready to pass judgment as these peoples are TERRORIST, because they are **Muslims**

**Here is why fake encounter is for?**

* BJP Rules Madhya Pradesh
* CM Shivraj Singh Chouhan is fed up with feeding CHICKEN BIRYANI in jail
* Some thing fishy, because jawan was kill in [Thirudan Police](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirudan_Police) movie style.
* The case against 8 peoples don't have evidence(FAKE), So the case may be dismissed by the court.
* The MP Police to hide their fault has to kill them.
* The youths were **Muslims**

The sad thing is one jawan and eighth innocent youth were killed (they under-trials and **NOT CONVICTS**), the case will be now easily closed.

## November 2016

### Tamil Nadu state enters 60th Year (Diamond jubilee)

On November 1st, 2016 is 60th Year (Diamond jubilee) of Tamil Nadu State formation.

The Tamils didn't in the mood to celebrate it, because most don't know the history about it. At a time when neighboring Kerala and Karnataka are celebrating the day.

The government should honor those people who have made sacrifices during the *frontier struggles* just like honoring those engaged in Independence struggle.

### Ex-Serviceman Committed Suicide over Pension

The 70-year-old ex-serviceman Ram Kishan Grewal from Haryana's Bhiwani district who served in the Army and the Defense Security Corps for 30 years, committed suicide by consuming poison over the issue of One Rank One Pension scheme (OROP).

Shame on the Govt, and their dirty politics. This is how we honor the hero's who sacrificed their time and life for the country. As usual the blame game started between politicians.

### Donald Trump becomes 45th US President

Donald Trump was elected as the 45th U.S. president in the 2016 election, defeating Hillary Clinton. At 70 years old, Trump will be the oldest person to assume the presidency.

### Denomination of Rs 500 and Rs 1000

In a surprise late evening move on 8th November 2016, prime minister Narendra Modi told the nation in a TV address, that come midnight, Rs 500 and Rs 1,000 notes will no longer be legal tender. You need to exchange these old notes for new one Rs 500 and Rs 2000 before 31st December 2016.

I guess Reliance Jio made the service as free till December 31st, 2016. Sounds logic.

### Zakir Naik's Organization IRF banned for 5 years

15th November, the fascist government banned IRF for 5 years.

Terming it as 'unlawful,' the Union Cabinet today decided to ban Islamic preacher Zakir Naik's NGO IRF (Islamic Research Foundation) for 5 years.

The ban has been enforced under the Unlawful Activities Prevention Act (UAPA) and was approved at a meeting of the Union Cabinet.

The Hidhutuva groups can't win him in debates, so the decided to ban IRF totally. Thus they they think they have stopped people know about the true Islam. The reverse should will happen, more people will accept the straight path.

Is **Peace TV** banned in India ?

### Indore-Patna train disaster killing 142 passengers.

With estimated 2,000 people on board the intercity express train when it came off the tracks around 3 am on Sunday, violently jolting passengers out of their sleep.

So far 143 bodies have been pulled from the mangled wreckage, a painstaking process involving metal cutters, heavy lifting equipment and sniffer dogs.

Many of the bodies are so badly damaged they are unrecognisable, and expect the toll to rise further as the worst affected carriages are cleared.

Since [BJP came to power](http://www.firstpost.com/india/patna-indore-express-tragedy-reveals-suresh-prabhu-has-been-all-talk-no-action-3116902.html)

* fares and fees have gone up dramatically.
* Charges exorbitant amounts for cancellations
* Doesn't give a full berth to kids if full fare is not paid
* Increased fares and freight rates under various pretexts.
* On top of that, dynamic pricing
* To many places train fares became more expensive than air travel
* Rs 1,20,000 crore safety fund called the Rashtriya Rail Sanraksha Kosh
* Track renewals is constantly coming down over the last six years.

> As on 1 July, 2014, 5300 kilometres track length is due for renewal. The target for the current year is only 2100 kilometres

PM is right when **he says the guilty should be punished**, guess who is the guilty.

**100 Musilms villagers of Mohammadpur and Hasemau** but media is not ready to say it openly

> But [TOI reported](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kanpur/Indore-Patna-express-derails-Up-for-pre-dawn-prayer-they-rushed-to-rescue/articleshow/55535087.cms) : A group of villagers saved 25 passengers' lives after the Indore-Patna express derailed early Sunday morning. Every person, who visited the accident site praised the courage and help extended by the villagers of Mohammadpur and Hasemau in saving so many lives in such an adverse situation.
>
> Many among the villagers, who were awake and were preparing for their morning 'puja' or '**namaz**', **left their rituals in the middle and rushed to the spot** to rescue passengers. "A group of about 100 from nearby villages of Mohammadpur and Hasemau reached the accident site after some of them witnessed sparks

The media is not ready to call them as **Muslims**, but they call them Villager, the same media is ready to call all Muslims are **terrorist**, even though the charges against them are not even proven. TOI also tried to change the word **Namaz** to Puja, so it can be generalised. Well done TOI



### Myanmar **ethnic cleansing** of Rohingya Muslims

UN officials has reported - **horrifying stories of gang rape, torture and murder emerge from among the thousands who have fled to Bangladesh**.

Up to 30,000 of the impoverished ethnic group have abandoned their homes in Myanmar to escape the unfolding violence, the UN says, after troops poured into the narrow strip where they live earlier this month authoised by Myanmar army and [Suu Kyi Govt](http://time.com/4582157/burma-myanmar-rohingya-bangladesh-arakan-ethnic-cleansing-suu-kyi/)

### Nabha jailbreak

As per [Indian Express ](http://indianexpress.com/article/india/india-news-india/nabha-jailbreak-tipped-off-harminder-singh-mintoo-tagged-along-4398879/): 12 men who carried out the **Nabha jailbreak** Sunday were hoping to free just four of their gang members but **Khalistan Liberation Force** militant Harminder Singh Mintoo and Kashmir Singh.

They reportedly [FIRED MORE THAN 100 ROUNDS](http://www.ndtv.com/india-news/khalistani-terrorist-harminder-mintoo-who-escaped-from-punjab-jail-caught-on-delhi-haryana-border-1631003) and within 10 minutes, left with the prisoners in four cars.

But the Khalistan Liberation Front **CHIEF** Harminder Singh Mintoo, who had escaped from Nabha jail on Sunday, was [arrested by the police in New Delhi on Monday](http://www.firstpost.com/india/nabha-jailbreak-harminder-singh-mintoo-khalistan-liberation-front-chief-arrested-3127514.html).

Here is the double standards by NEWS, MEDIA AND AUTHORITIES

- Harminder Singh Mintoo is respectfully called as **CHIEF** by FIRSTPOST.COM
- As per INDIANEXPRESS.COM it is **ARMED MEN** who carried out the Nabha jailbreak
- NDTV reported fired more than 100 rounds and freed **prisoners** - Armed with weapons, but still able catch them live, no encounter like Bhopal
- Not big buzz in the media on news

Almost all medias are not using word **Terrorist**, I know because they are not Muslims. This is the state of present India, where only Muslims are portrayed as terrorist.

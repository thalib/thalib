excerpt: The time when your money is not your - Demonetisation of 1000 & 500 Rs
---

The recent demonetisation is collective punishment for honest tax payers, the poor and middle class Indians as a whole. Its impact on curtailing black money will be almost very less, and it will be known over a period of time.

This will create **negative shock** to the nation, this is already felt.

> Its not due to Economic its all because of corruption

### What is BLACK MONEY ?

- When a money transaction is done without paying tax, is called unaccounted cash or black money
- When a person hides his total income, and thus avoids tax creates black money

In reality these are not black money, when government robs people legally, people will hide it from the government. This behavior is natural, after paying INCOME TAX why the hell should someone pay high INDIRECT TAX on everything while we buy or sell.

The best solution is to **Reducing the TAX rate**, If the tax is less everyone will be happy to pay the minimal tax and enjoy their earnings.

The **real black money** is

* those take bribes when making government deals
* Those who have **70 Lakhs crores** in Swiss bank accounts
* The willful defaulters (SC ask for the list, RBI won't give)
* corporates and companies who steel and destroy our natural resources
* Politicians and their binamis
* Leading lawyers who back the corruption and corporates
* casinos, prostitution brothels

> Black money comes mainly from India
> - Julian Assange, WikiLeaks Founder

### Fake currency

Another reason said by the Modi Govt is to curb fake Indian currency notes.

Do you know how the fake currency comes into India,

> Via Pak boarder and Bangla boarder

If  it comes in container, then Govt and military is in full cooperation mode.

### Learning

> Don't punish for not using dustbin, before placing the dustbin

Correct the law, then bring the change. until then it is now use baby.

> Don't use currency for savings, especially India Rupees

### RBI governor Urjit Patel is the Scapegoat

Now RBI governor Urjit Patel is the **Scapegoat**, The All India Bank Officers Confederation has called for the resignation of Reserve Bank of India governor Urjit Patel for being a party to demonetization, which it claims has brought havoc in economy and in the life of common public.

> May be this is the reason why the Raguram Ranjan was changed.

### Black Money to Go Cashless

In **Mann Ki Baat** broadcasted on 27, Nov 2016 PM Modi changed his tone, from black money, corruption and counterfeit currency to cashless economy. BJP govt was stressing people to go for cashless mode from day one as alternative, but now PM, FM and the Govt circle started openly promoting (marketing) App payment, Credit Card, Debit Card, etc. Its a major shift to cashless economy

Most of the India is still run on Cash, this irks the FDI when where they come and setup super duper store, e-conmmerce and but no people show up there. Now your cash is gone, you are not allowed to withdraw above cap limit.

> The real message is either use Credit/debit/app payment or Die.

### Reply of an X Army men

A retired Indian Army veteran has something to say about demonetization. What he has to say is a tight slap on all those who drag our soldiers to defend their lame arguments to hide truth.

Lieutenant Colonel Darshan Dhillon retired from the Indian Army in 2006. Currently living in Punjab's Ludhiana, Colonel Dhillon went to an ATM in the city to withdraw some cash.

In a [Facebook post](This is his Facebook post.), Dhillon said,

> "I was standing in long ATM queue and getting irritated on mismanagement on a good issue. The fellow Modi bhakt behind gave me a quick reaction by saying, why are you perturbed think about about army persons standing 20 hrs in day on border.".
>
> Narrating how his reply removed the man's "nationalism with a jolt," he wrote, "my curt reply removed his deshbhagti with a jolt when I told him that I did that on border for 20 years and standing here to withdraw my pension on that account. He should show his deshbhagti in getting us actual **OROP and CPC** from Modi ji rather than issuing certificates in ATM lines [SIC]."

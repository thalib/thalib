excerpt: Jallikattu 2017
---

What we're seeing now is an accumulated hurt because of the Delhi's continuous contempt towards the state.

> Be it the Tamil fishermen's issue, the Tamil Eelam issue, the Cauvery issue and now Jallikattu, in none of these the outcome has been in favour of the state. The ban on Jallikattu, in that sense, adds to the recurring rhetoric that Tamils are targeted.

### PETA, BJP and RSS connections

* In 2000, PETA, entered into India, clamining protector of animals
* PETA is the pomoter of VEGAN Diet
* Thus promoted RSS agenda: cow is sacred; Cow is God, Only cow milk is good; Eating beef is SIN
* Recently BJP Minister declared, cow is the only animal that inhales and exhales oxygen, COW DUNG neutralizes harmful radioactive elements.
* But all BJP, PETA and RSS are silent about BEEF meat export, India is the world largest BEEF exporter.
* Top BEEF exporting companies are owned and operated by BJP functionaires
* But BEEF eating Indian's are looked down, disgrased and murdered.
* If Indian's are banned from BEEF, then the BJP BEEF exporters will get more business
* COW's are not only used for BEEF, but they also extract Leather, and other extracts for paramatical and food byproducts
* Bigges exporter are spreading red meat (BEEF) causes cancer, BP, etc..,
* BEEF is banned, but not Goat , fish and Chicken
* Vegan Diet promotes eating only vegs, leafs, pulses, milk
* Important components of vegan diet is Soya (soya is primarly imported)
* Milk and its by products are already in the control of MNC

There are many points, the important is

> Only native breeds cows are capables of producing good fertilizer

Until the native breeds are extinct it is not possible to take contorl of entire food market. Out of entire India, only Tamil Nadu has the highest number **30** of native breeds today, but once had 200+.

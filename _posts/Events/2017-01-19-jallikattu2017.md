What we're seeing now is an accumulated hurt because of the Delhi's continuous contempt towards the state.

### What is Jallikattu ?

Also known as [Eruthazhuvuthal or Manju virattu, Jallikattu](http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/jallikattu-cheat-sheet-10-things-you-should-know-about-the-bull-taming-sport/articleshow/56664079.cms) is a traditional bull-taming sport organised in Tamil Nadu during Pongal. Historicaly the practice dates back to as far as 2000 years ago. The sport involves a natively reared stud that is set free inside an arena filled with young participants(mostly men in their 20s). The challenge lies in taming the bull with bare hands.

Participants often try to grab the bull by its horns or tail and wrestle it into submission. A few also tend to latch on to the bull by clinging to the hump at the back of its neck. Jallikattu events do not offer any major monetary benefits, and prizes are mostly a dhoti, towel, betel leaves, bananas and token cash — that is rarely more than Rs 101 — on a silver plate. Mixer-grinders, refrigerators and furniture have been added to the list of prizes at some events over the last few years.

Jallikattu had always been more a way to honour bull-owners than a competitive sport. It is mainly active in the districts of Madurai, Tiruchirappalli, Theni, Pudukkottai and Dindigul of Tamil Nadu. Jallikattu is closely associated with village life and the bulls are specially reared for this purpose. Breeders often claim they treat the bulls like their own children and spend large sums of money towards their upkeep. Many participants, however, are either fatally gored, trampled or mauled by the bull.

### This outbrust is not just for Jallikattu

> Be it the Tamil fishermen's issue, the Tamil Eelam issue, the Cauvery issue and now Jallikattu, in none of these the outcome has been in favour of the state. The ban on Jallikattu, in that sense, adds to the recurring rhetoric that Tamils are targeted.

> I don't understand why should, we need permisson from Supreme Court

Protests are on high swing, this time its by all (youths, political parties, celibs and more)

### Youths outbrust

Jallikattu events were held in some parts,

The protests began in Madurai, Sivaganga, and Pattukottai, , the state capital became the hotbed after the arrest of 200 protesting youths in Alanganallur village proved to act as a catalyst. Chennai’s Marina beach saw an unexpected crowd of Jallikattu supporters who camped at the beach even during the night. The first 50 protesters reached the Marina Beach on Tuesday morning, at around 8 am. By midnight, the crowd had swelled to about 6,000. Students, software professionals, playback singers, filmmakers, bank employees — all gathered to protest against the ban on Jallikattu.

The protesters demanded is one

> that the chief minister issue a statement to clarify the state's position on the Jallikattu issue and added that the protest will not cease until such a time.

* It looks like [Tamil Nadu version of the Arab Spring](http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/chennai/tamil-nadu-witnessing-mass-students-uprising-for-jallikattu/articleshow/56641218.cms), or it may even remind you of the anti-Hindi agitation in the state in the 1960s. It is happening students and youngsters are on the roads and public places demanding the conduct of jallikattu, the traditional bull-taming sport in the state.

Its not Jallikattu vs PETA - Many see PETA as a vehicle “Delhi” has used to further oppress Tamil Nadu.

> PETA has done a huge service to a sport (Jallikattu) that would have otherwise perhaps faded away

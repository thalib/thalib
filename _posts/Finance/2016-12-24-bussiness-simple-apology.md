> A simple apology would have solved the issue.

Instead customer service team [or] business owner blatantly trying to prove they are correct, a simple apology would have solved the issue.

A business is ther because of customers like us, If there is no customer, then no business. Many times we customers are willing to forgive, because no one is perfect.

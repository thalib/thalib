excerpt: The time when your money is not your - Demonetisation of 1000 & 500 Rs
---

The recent demonetisation is collective punishment for honest tax payers, the poor and middle class Indians as a whole. Its impact on curtailing black money will be almost very less, and it will be known over a period of time.

This will create **negative shock** to the nation, this is already felt.

* Stock market is already crashing
* Value of rupee goes down
* Price rise, in general commodity
* Production halt in industries
* Business are stalled, due to no change
* Reprinting cost of new currency
* Tourism will get hurt
* all important peoples suffering

> India Is Rich, But The People Are Poor

> Its not due to Economic its all because of corruption

### What is BLACK MONEY ?

- When a money transaction is done without paying tax, is called unaccounted cash or black money
- When a person hides his total income, and thus avoids tax creates black money

In reality these are not black money, when government robs people legally, people will hide it from the government. This behavior is natural, after paying INCOME TAX why the hell should someone pay high INDIRECT TAX on everything while we buy or sell.

The best solution is to **Reducing the TAX rate**, If the tax is less everyone will be happy to pay the minimal tax and enjoy their earnings.

The **real black money** is

* those take bribes when making government deals
* Those who have **70 Lakhs crores** in Swiss bank accounts
* The willful defaulters (SC ask for the list, RBI won't give)
* corporates and companies who steel and destroy our natural resources
* Politicians and their binamis
* Leading lawyers who back the corruption and corporates
* Shutdown casinos, prostitution brothels

### Fake currency

Another reason said by the Modi Govt is to curb fake Indian currency notes.

Do you know how the fake currency comes into India,

> Via Pak boarder and Bangla boarder

If  it comes in container, then Govt and military is in full cooperation mode.

### Learning

> Don't punish for not using dustbin, before placing the dustbin

Correct the law, then bring the change. until then it is now use baby.

> Don't use currency for savings, especially India Rupees

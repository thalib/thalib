Short guide, from my very old notes on how to use BDI2000

Download the BDI setup utility from their [ftp](ftp://78.31.64.234/bdigdb/)

* Check whether configuration file is correct.
* Check whether the network cable is properly connected.

## BDI Setup

```
[root@localhost tmp]# bdisetup -u -p/dev/ttyS0 -b115 -aGDB -tMPC8500
Connecting to BDI loader

[mohamed@localhost mohamed]$ bdisetup -c -p/dev/ttyS0 -b115 -s -i192.168.0.246 -h192.168.0.240 -fcscard.cfg -m255.255.255.0
Connecting to BDI loader
Writing network configuration
Configuration passed

[mohamed@localhost mohamed]$ bdisetup -v -p/dev/ttyS0 -b115 -s
BDI Type : BDI2000 Rev.C (SN: 97956725)
Loader   : V1.05
Firmware : V1.02 bdiGDB for MPC85xx
Logic    : V1.02 PPC6xx/PPC7xx
MAC      : 00-0c-01-97-95-67
IP Addr  : 192.168.0.246
Subnet   : 255.255.255.0
Gateway  : 255.255.255.255
Host IP  : 192.168.0.240
Config   : cscard.cfg
```

## Flashing U-Boot with BDI

The U-Boot can be flashed using BDI with the following sequence of commands. Telnet to BDI before proceeding with these commands.

Make sure the Host IP is set properly using the following command. In case if Host IP is not set properly, the change can be made by passing the IP address as a parameter to the **host** command.

```

BDI> host
192.168.0.246
BDI> host 192.168.3.201

```
Erase the flash.

```
 BDI> erase
```

Program U-Boot file using the **prog** command.

```
BDI> prog 0xfff80000 u-boot.bin bin
```

The **prog** command has the following syntax:

```
prog <offset> <image-file> <image-type> 
```

Where the image-type includes one of SREC, BIN, AOUT or ELF.

To run the U-Boot from the BDI, give the **go** command.

```
BDI> go
```

This would initialize the boot loader and the output could be grabbed from the debug port/console of the board.
